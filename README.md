# Challenge
Katas for learning languages &amp; working on code

# Description
Each folder contains an assignment to be worked out in the language of choice. This is currently just 
for my son and I to trade coding challenges but can be extended in future to anyone who wishes to participate.

Within each folder is a file called README.md the file contains the requirements for the challenge. All solutions
are kept in folders beneath the main one, based on which language is in use (C#, Java, Ruby, ...). Depending
upon the solution, the code may or may not be fully compilable, but it should always be valid syntax and able 
to be cut &amp; pasted into working code without change.

Enjoy!
